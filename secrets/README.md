Mechanic ePortal

This application is intended for use by mechanic shops, insurance firms, as well as customers to such insurance companies. The main idea behind it is to generate a have all solution that increases information transparency. The mechanics will be able to access multiple screens that hold relevant data, such as the info attached to the customer for the vehicle he or she brought in to get repaired / looked at. There is also information relevant to the parts that the mechanic will need in order to satisfy a customers request. If the parts are not in stock, the mechanic is able to access a screen where an order form can be submitted to get the relevant parts. If a new customer comes to the shop, the mechanic can create a file for them, allowing ease of access should they come again to the shop at a future date.

The customer side of the portal is less comprehensive than the mechanic side. This is an intentional decision; customers donâ€™t need to know all the ins and outs of how a mechanic or insurance firm handles the case, but do need to know how soon they can pick up the vehicle, as well as what they are responsible for ordering to ensure the vehicle can be fixed.

The insurance side will be relevant for insurance firms that handle claims brought in to the mechanic shop. The management at the firm will be able to find agents who worked on specific claims as well. To submit a new claim, it becomes easy, as the portal will take the user right to the page where claims can be added. 

The purpose of this platform is meant to create a system where, in real time, customers, insurance firms, and mechanics can communicate and update each other in their own processes. This will help alleviate the confusion that many a customer deal with when dropping off their vehicles for repair, and not hearing any updates for sometimes days at a time.
